		<h3>Overview</h3>

				<h4>The Challenge</h4>
				<div>
					<p>“It seems like the site tries to cater to everyone at once, but is unsuccessful at both ends”
						<br><br>OpenJustice came to us with a problem: how can criminal justice data be made approachable for laypeople while simultaneously being useful and effective for more active data users? Our client had a broad idea of the site’s issues and came to us for recommendations on what changes need to be made to make it more user-friendly. 
					</p>

			</div>
			<div class="content-row">
				<h4>The Solution</h4>
				<div>
					<p>A two tiered approach to navigation directing different types of users to the appropriate data sets
						<br><br>The key insight we found in our research was that users tended to approach data in one of two ways: as an expert interested in digging deep to find a specific data set OR as someone who is interested in the information but would prefer a more curated experience. This insight helped drive our understanding of the problem and shaped our ultimate design.

		<h3>Process</h3>
			<div class="content">
			<br><h4>Research</h4>
				<p>In two and a half short weeks were were able to speak to 23 individuals regarding OpenJustice (11 laypeople, 6 data scientists, 4 journalists and 2 members of law enforcement). Usability testing and user interviews were vital for us in determining the major flaws in the current site. It became abundantly clear that the use of jargon, inconsistent navigation, unclear filtering and an overwhelming amount of copy made the site very confusing.<br><br><br>
				<img src="../../img/javier.png">
				<br><br>The next step was to develop personas in order to guide our design decisions and help narrate the story to the client. The three personas were all based on our research and show the different types of users that may frequent the site.

			<h4>Strategy</h4>
				<p>Following the research phase, we began brainstorming the optimal ways to restructure the primary and secondary site navigation. The actual content on the site was excellent; we just needed to come up with a way to let specific users find the data sets (and their accompanying features) in an easy and efficient way. The before and after site maps can be viewed <a href="OJ_Sitemaps.html">here</a>.<br><br>
				Our approach to the redesign and the recommendations we provided to the client was:
				</p>
				<div class="bullet-point">
					• <span>Clarifying and streamlining</span>: To some extent, all users got lost or confused while using the site. By making navigation consistent and minimal we made it much easier for a user to understand where they are in the site and exactly what page they’re looking at. By recommending the removal of jargon words (or the ability to hover-define them) we dealt with the issues of terminology confusion. Finally, by paring down overwhelming copy we allowed the users to get to what they were looking for immediately. 
 
					<br><br>• <span>Visually relaying the message</span>: Compared to other government websites, OpenJustice is clean and minimal in its visual design. However, users did note on some glaring inconsistencies in brand. I approached the visual redesign with OpenJustice’s message in mind: a modern, user-centered approach to data visualization that still retains the authority and credibility of a government website.
					<br><br>• <span>Accounting for future growth</span>: OpenJustice is a relatively new site and the stakeholders were very excited at the prospect of building it out and adding various features in the future. Our design accounts for this by splitting up the current pages into two main categories, allowing for nesting in the future or the addition of a third and fourth category as needed. 
				</div>
				<br><br>
			<h4>Ideation</h4>
			<p>Considering the research and and client goals, we starting off ideation with a round of wireframes (<a href="OJ_Wireframes.html">see here</a>). For the finishing touch, I added a layer of visual design to present to the client the full experience of their updated website.
			<img src="../../img/OJ_Mockups.png">
			Our redesign focused on the three primary pages on the site:
				<div class="bullet-point">
					• <span>HOME PAGE</span>: The updated homepage features two main options for exploring the site's content. The global navigation is pared down to reflect the hierarchy of the site.<br><br> 
					• <span>DATA STORIES</span>: Data stories is where users can explore data visualizations alongside curated text to give the statistics contextual relevance. We restructed the layout of each page to immediately display all of the available sections (as opposed to having to scroll without an index). We also recommended that large chunks of copy be nested to not overwhelm the user.<br><br>
					• <span>DATA EXPLORATION</span>: We recommended that the filters be open and visible at all time. The site initially had dropdown menus for each filter option and no way to see what was filtered after the dropdown closed. We applied design best practices in order to recommend the most appropriate types of filters (sliders, checkboxes, dropdown menus) to make searching for specific data as intuitive and simple as possible.

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<div class="content">
			<p>At the end of our two and a half week sprint we presented our findings and recommendations to the client and handed off the deliverables. The client was thrilled with the research and solutions we provided because it helped clear up a lot of internal debates on how to present the data and structure the site. Ultimately, the site was updated and redesigned keeping all of our recommendations in mind.
			<br><br>By streamlining navigation and cleaning up the confusing elements of the site, we helped OpenJustice further promote the sense of transparency they are working towards. Users from all backgrounds can now feel confident that the data they are viewing (and all accompanying features and copy) is relevant, helpful and clear. Through this, we help drive the goal of creating a more open California.
