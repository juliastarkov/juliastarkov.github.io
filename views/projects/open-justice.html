			<h4>The Challenge</h4>
			<p>“It seems like the site tries to cater to everyone at once, but is unsuccessful at both ends”
				<br><br>OpenJustice came to us with a problem: how can criminal justice data be made approachable for laypeople while simultaneously being useful and effective for more active data users? Our client had a broad idea of the site’s issues and came to us for recommendations on what changes need to be made to make it more user-friendly.</p>
			<h4>The Solution</h4>
			<p>A two tiered approach to navigation directing different types of users to the appropriate data sets
				<br><br>The key insight we found in our research was that users tended to approach data in one of two ways: as an expert interested in digging deep to find a specific data set OR as someone who is interested in the information but would prefer a more curated experience. This insight helped drive our understanding of the problem and shaped our ultimate design recommendations.</p>

		<h3>Process</h3>
		<div class="content">
			<h4>Research</h4>
			<p>Initial research was conducted to gather a greater understanding of the market and potential competitors. Currently, there is a growing number of bot building tools. I explored their UI and UX and found:<br>
				<br>- Competitors’ products tend to have shoddy usability and are overly complicated. <br>
				<br>- Competitors tend to focus on chatbots and voice assistants, leaving open space for a tool that automates visual avatars. <br>
				<br> User research was an interesting challenge. My number one point person was our content writer and strategist, who would be a direct, internal user for the tool. Working with him was an integral part of learning about best practices for writing for bots and tool feature requirements.</p>
			<h4>Strategy</h4>
			<p>Since writing bot content will inevitably be a new experience for most users, developing a clear product flow was crucial for usability. Our goal was to mirror the way bot content writers break out conversation while maintaining clear, visual paths through a system that often becomes unwieldy and complicated.</p><img src="../../img/Botanic-Product-User-Flow.png">

			<h4>Ideation: Wireframes</h4>
			<p>Wireframing began with a series of paper sketches and whiteboarding in collaboration with the team. In order to heighten usability and develop an intuitive, plug and play tool, I focused primarily on:
				<br><br>- Nesting: The product has a ton of functionality, but a lot of the features are for rare (yet crucial) use cases. Nesting certain parts in order to provide default settings with the option of added granularity aided in designing an approachable and uncluttered workspace.
				<br><br>- Consistent modal interactions: Modals contain fields/options and are used throughout the product. The choice of a modal (over a separate page) was a way to keep interactions grounded in the main Workspace area while giving focus to specific interactions.
				<br><br>- Functional hover states: Another variation of nesting, many of the components in the tool have hover states that also expose the option to edit/delete. This is a learnable behavior that helps keep the workspace minimal, while also unlocking additional functionality just a click away.
				<br><br>(Currently, the wireframes are under NDA until official product launch)</p>
			<h4>Ideation: Mockups</h4>
			<p>Working on the wireframes was an incredibly iterative and collaborative process. Understanding technical limitations/capabilities as well as bot creation best practices and requirements was crucial to the success of the product development cycle and ultimate result. 
				<br><br>Visual design was used in the tool as a way to enhance the experience through:
				<br><br>- Consistency in visual language: Using a tight color scheme and repetitive visual elements (such as icons and button shapes), the entire product has a sense of polish and serves to avoid any distraction from the flow. 
				<br><br>- Clear calls to action: The use of bright colors is sparse and used to clearly indicate actionable elements. Hover states on all clickable options were also important as way to give users immediate feedback on the state of an element. 
				<br><br>I developed dozens of visual assets, including pixel-perfect mockups, design specifications and handcrafted icon files. I managed the front end development of these mockups and worked closely with backend developers to ensure proper and timely application. 
				<br><br>(Currently, the mockups and other assets are under NDA until official product launch)</p>
			<h4>Beta Testing Program & Iteration</h4>
			<p>Botanic was able to secure a handful of potential customers interested in participating in our beta program. I managed the entire UX/UI research segment of the program. 
			<br><br>Consisting of a round of usability testing and user interviews, we were able to gather valuable insights about the strengths and weaknesses of the product with a group of users that were very interested in creating their own bots. These insights were incredibly helpful in determining priorities in terms of product enhancements, feature requests and general design upgrades. Collaborating closely with the development team, iteration is ongoing.

		<h3>Results</h3>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The initial wireframes I developed were used in a deck to successfully help secure investment for Botanic. This was a great opportunity for us and gave us the funding to continue to build out the product. 
				<br><br>Personally, working through the full-cycle of product design was an awesome challenge. It reinforced the absolute necessity of an open, collaborative, and iterative team in creating successful and thoughtful products. 
				<br><br>We’re currently iterating and working on ways to enhance the Author’s Tool even further and starting preparations for official product launch in July 2018.
